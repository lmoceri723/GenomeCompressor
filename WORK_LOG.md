| Nov 13 | 4:10-4:40pm |       I looked at canvas and the slides and learned about how to read and write from/to binary files. Then, I started on an initial draft of the expand function. I'm optimistic about it. |
| Nov 13 | 4:40-5:10pm | I continued working on expand and compress and fully wrote both functions. I tried to figure out how to test my code, but I'm missing something. I'll ask Mr. Blick during the next class. |
