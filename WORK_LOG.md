Then, I started on an initial draft of the expand function. I'm optimistic about it. |

I tried to figure out how to test my code, but I'm missing something. I'll ask Mr. Blick during the next class. |
| Nov 17 | 10:45-11:15pm | I asked a friend for help with testing code and got it to work. I simplified some of my functions trying to fix a strange error. Virus.txt seems to be corrupted. I've tried almost everything, making sure binary in and out weren't changed, adding exceptions, etc. I have a large assortment of \n and \r characters in my string and removing them still breaks things. I plan to take a late and try moving my code to my mac to see if its a windows issue. |

I think I'm going to use it while we work on compression. I tried both test cases, and they worked. Then, I wrote comments and polished everything. My code fully works and I'm done with the final version. |
